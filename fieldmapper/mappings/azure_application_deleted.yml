falsepositives:
    - Application being deleted may be performed by a system administrator.
    - Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
        changes in your environment.
    - Application deleted from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior
        is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
