falsepositives:
    - Container Registry being created or deleted may be performed by a system administrator.
        Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
        changes in your environment.
    - Container Registry created or deleted from unfamiliar users should be investigated.
        If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the
        rule.
