description: 'Detects an executable initiating a network connection to "LocaltoNet"
    tunneling sub-domains.

    LocaltoNet is a reverse proxy that enables localhost services to be exposed to
    the Internet.

    Attackers have been seen to use this service for command-and-control activities
    to bypass MFA and perimeter controls.
