falsepositives:
    - Device or device configuration being modified or deleted may be performed by
        a system administrator.
    - Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
        changes in your environment.
    - Device or device configuration modified or deleted from unfamiliar users should
        be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted
        from the rule.
