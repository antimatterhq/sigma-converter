title: Cisco Duo Successful MFA Authentication Via Bypass Code
status: experimental
level: medium
description: 'Detects when a successful MFA authentication occurs due to the use of
    a bypass code.

    A bypass code is a temporary passcode created by an administrator for a specific
    user to access a Duo-protected application. These are generally used as "backup
    codes," so that enrolled users who are having problems with their mobile devices
    (e.g., mobile service is disrupted, the device is lost or stolen, etc.) or who
    temporarily can''t use their enrolled devices (on a plane without mobile data
    services) can still access their Duo-protected systems.
