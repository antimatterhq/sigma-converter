falsepositives:
    - Storage Buckets being enumerated may be performed by a system administrator.
        Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making
        changes in your environment.
    - Storage Buckets enumerated from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If
        known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
