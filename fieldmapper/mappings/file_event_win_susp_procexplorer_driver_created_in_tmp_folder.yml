title: Suspicious PROCEXP152.sys File Created In TMP
status: test
level: medium
description: 'Detects the creation of the PROCEXP152.sys file in the application-data
    local temporary folder.

    This driver is used by Sysinternals Process Explorer but also by KDU (https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU)
    or Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs), which uses
    KDU.

falsepositives:
    - Other legimate tools using this driver and filename (like Sysinternals). Note
        - Clever attackers may easily bypass this detection by just renaming the driver
        filename. Therefore just Medium-level and don't rely on it.
