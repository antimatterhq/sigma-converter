falsepositives:
    - Rule Collections (Application, NAT, and Network) being modified or deleted may
        be performed by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity,
        user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.
    - Rule Collections (Application, NAT, and Network) modified or deleted from unfamiliar
        users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives,
        it can be exempted from the rule.
