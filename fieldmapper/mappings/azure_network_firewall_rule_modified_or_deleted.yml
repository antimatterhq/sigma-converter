falsepositives:
    - Firewall Rule Configuration being modified or deleted may be performed by a
        system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or
        hostname should be making changes in your environment.
    - Firewall Rule Configuration modified or deleted from unfamiliar users should
        be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted
        from the rule.
