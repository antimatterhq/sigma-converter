title: AWS EFS Fileshare Modified or Deleted
status: test
level: medium
description: 'Detects when a EFS Fileshare is modified or deleted.

    You can''t delete a file system that is in use.

    If the file system has any mount targets, the adversary must first delete them,
    so deletion of a mount will occur before deletion of a fileshare.
