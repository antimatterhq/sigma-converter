falsepositives:
    - Automated processes that uses Terraform may lead to false positives.
    - SAML Provider could be updated by a system administrator. Verify whether the
        user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your
        environment.
    - SAML Provider being updated from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If
        known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
