  "description": "Entity Management events report activity by a managed client, a micro service, or a user at a management console. The activity can be a create, read, update, and delete operation on a managed entity. Note that if the operation does not concern a specific entity (e.g. it is a list operation across multiple entities) then it probably doesn't belong here. Conversely, if the action DOES involve changing or interacting (even reading) the attributes of a specific entity, such as a user or role, then this class is a good fit",
